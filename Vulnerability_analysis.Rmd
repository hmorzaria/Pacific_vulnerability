##Abstract

## Methods

We selected coastal communities in the Mexican Pacific. Initially we selected all coastal municipalities by intersecting existing municipalities with Mexico's Exclusive Economic Zone. We then selected populations with fisheries businesses registered in the National Registry of Economic Units (Directorio Estadístico Nacional de Unidades Económicas). All spatial layers were obtained from the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (http://www.inegi.org.mx/). Finally, we combined these communities with localities were fisheries offices are located. The final layer represented fishing-dependent communities and was used for the vulnerability analysis.
